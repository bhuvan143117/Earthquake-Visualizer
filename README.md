# Volcano Eruption Mapping
Created by N.Bhuvaneshwar
This Project Visualizes the Volcano eruptions and Earthquake data on an interactive map.
It uses Leaflet.js and GeoJSON data to display active regions with real time updates.

> Interactive maps using jQuery, Leaflet, GeoJSON data to map earthquakes.

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days with jQuery, Leaflet, GeoJSON data.

## Analysis

Use a set of URLs to map earthquake data (USGS) and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and use different styles of maps to display the information.

Data:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josem279/Mapping_Earthquakes/main/4.5_week.geojson

## Results

Your approach will be to use jQuery library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data that is hosted on earthquake.usgs.gov. Using a Mapbox API, the Leaflet JS library through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
